# Aviator: The Ultimate Guide for Indian Players

## What is Aviator?

Aviator is an online multiplayer game developed by Spribe, where players
bet on the outcome of a virtual plane\'s flight. The plane takes off,
and a multiplier increases as it ascents. Players must cash out before
the plane flies away or crashes, and their winnings are determined by
the multiplier they cashed out at.
